    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
        I'm an undergraduate senior at the University of Colorado Boulder. <br>
	My major is in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology; however, I have taken <br>
	double as many courses in Applied Math (probability & statistics) and <br>
	Geography (remote sensing). <br>
	<br>
        I began my research experience in bioinformatics, but I found a<br>
	paid job at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, creating and <br>
	documenting remotely sensed data products. With an analysis and <br>
	remote sensing background, I landed an Analytics Hub internship at <br>
	CU/CIRES's Earth Lab. <br>
	<br>
	For the last couple years, I have made predictive models for the <br>
	occurance, management, and impacts of natural disasters. These <br>
	projects have focused on tornadoes and wildfires and have required <br>
	a broad set of technical skills, including but not limited to:
	<ul>
	    <li>Deep Learning</li>
  	    <li>AWS EC2, S3</li>
  	    <li>Docker</li>
  	    <li>CPU/GPU parallelization</li>
  	    <li>Python, Bash, R</li>	
	</ul>
